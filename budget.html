          Budgeting is a critical tool for managing personal and financial well-being. It provides a structured approach to handling finances, ensuring that your income is effectively allocated to cover necessities, savings, and discretionary spending. By creating and following a budget, individuals can gain a clear understanding of their financial situation, making it easier to track expenses, reduce debt, and plan for future goals.

      <div class="budget-main-header-list">
        <ol class="default-list">
          <li>Step 1. Input your income</li>
          <p>Use the <a target="_blank" href="inputs.html">Inputs</a> section to input your various forms of income. 
            This data will then be stored persistently in the background for you to use in the rest of the bugeting application. </p>
          <li>Step 2. Create your budget</li>
          <p>Back on the home page (below) you will be able to input your various cost, again sorted by category, using the information 
            you included in the prior stage to give you a total budget to work with.
          </p>
          <li>Step 3. View the Graphs</li>
          <p>Trends captured through the budget itself will dynamically create graphical representations and disply them on the page,
            showing for example, the amount of money spent per category of your budget, and how much you spend on debt, etc. 
          </p>
          <li>Step 4: Perform AI analysis of your data for saving recommendations</li>
          <p>You can use our AI plugin to ask prompt based questions to generate recommendations based on your budget, to gain insight in to 
            how you can make ammendments to save more money - for example:
          </p>
          <p class ="p-quotes">"Where can I cut back in my budget to save an extra £100 per month?</p>
          <p class ="p-quotes">"How much can I save per year to put towards a new car based on my current budget?</p>
          <p class ="p-quotes">"Do you have any recommendations with what I can do with my extra savings each month?</p>
