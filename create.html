      Think about the regular expenses you incur each month, such as rent, utilities, groceries, 
      or subscriptions like streaming services or gym memberships. These recurring items 
      are critical to include in your budget because they represent the core financial commitments 
      you need to cover consistently. By adding these items to your budget, you’re taking the first step 
      in gaining a clearer picture of where your money is going each month. 
      Simply select the type of expense and input it into the table below to get started.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Modal 2 -->
  <div class="create-modal create-modal-instructions-2" id="modal-2">
    <span class="close" id="close-cross-2">&times;</span>
    <p>
      Assigning an exact cost to each budget item is crucial for accurate tracking and analysis. 
      Whether you’re estimating or using exact figures from your bank statements or bills, 
      try to be as specific as possible. For example, rather than estimating your grocery bill at 
      £200, look at your actual receipts and input £185 if that’s the actual amount. The more detailed 
      you are in this stage, the more effective your future analysis will be when 
      it comes to identifying patterns and making adjustments to improve your financial health.
    </p>

  <!-- Modal 3 -->

    <span class="close" id="close-cross-3">&times;</span>
    <p>
      Once you’ve added your expenditure, it’s important to categorize it correctly. 
      Our tool offers a range of pre-defined categories, such as debt, lifestyle, 
      entertainment, and savings, to help you organize your expenses effectively. 
      Grouping your expenses in this way allows you to quickly identify where your money 
      is going. For example, you might discover that you’re spending more on dining out 
      (lifestyle) than you had realized, or that your debt repayment category is taking 
      up a significant portion of your budget. Use these categories to better 
      understand your spending habits and make more informed decisions about your finances.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Modal 4 -->
  <div class="create-modal create-modal-instructions-4" id="modal-4">
    <span class="close" id="close-cross-4">&times;</span>
    <p>
      If you have expenses that don’t fit neatly into our pre-defined categories, 
      feel free to create your own custom category. This allows you to 
      tailor your budget specifically to your lifestyle and financial situation. 
      For instance, if you have a hobby or side business with regular expenses, 
      you can create a category just for that. These custom categories will be 
      carried through the entire budgeting process, ensuring that your unique 
      spending is included in the analysis and reports. Later, when you review your 
      data, you’ll see these categories reflected in charts and insights, 
      helping you make adjustments where necessary.
